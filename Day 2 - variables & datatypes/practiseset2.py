# Q.1 :- Write a python program to add two numbers

# a = 25

# b= 25

# total = a + b
# print(total)

# Q.2 :- Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

# dividend = int(input("Enter a number dividend:-"))

# divisor = int(input('Enter a number divisor:-'))

# remainder = int(dividend % divisor)

# # we use modular oeparator in it :- %

# print(remainder)

# Q.3 :- Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

# a = input("Enter the value of a :- ")

# print(type(a))

# Q.4 :- Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

# a = 34

# b = 80

# result = a > b

# print(result)


# Q.5 :-  Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

# num1 = int(input("Enter number 1 :-  "))

# num2 = int(input("Enter number 2 :- "))

# average  = (num1 +  num2 )/2

# print(average)

# Q.6 :-  Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user

# square = int(input("Enter a number:- "))

# result = square * square

# print(result)
